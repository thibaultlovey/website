## Hi ! Welcome to my website!

My name is Thibault and I am a medical professional with a passion for public health and humanitarian medicine.
In December 2020, I joined the PHD program at the Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Patricia Schlagenhauf. My research focuses on respiratory infections, with a particular interest in Long Covid and tracking infections using mobile applications.

On my website, you’ll find my CV, publications, and talks. If you have any questions or just want to say hello, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I love connecting with new people and am always happy to chat. Thank you for visiting and enjoy your time here!
