Mobile-based surveillance offers the opportunity to capture additional disease reports in real time, complementing and enhancing the existing health system.\nObjective: We aimed to evaluate patterns of illness in travelers using self-reported symptom information through a mobile-app based system.\nMethod: This study uses a novel mobile application called Infection Tracking in Travellers (ITIT) that records travel-related symptoms with associated geolocation and weather data. Participant recruitment was conducted in travel clinics across Europe beginning in December 2021 and is currently ongoing. Data from the app were used to examine travel and illness patterns and link them to location and weather/climate information to create profiles of travellers and examine illness hotspots.\nResults: 396 participants were recruited until January 2023, with an average age of 38 years old (18 to 88 years old), and an average travel duration of 22 days. The majority of participants were travelling for leisure/tourism (61.9%), followed by visiting friends and relatives (18.2%) and business travel (14.4%). Every UN global subregion was visited by at least one traveller, most commonly Western Europe, followed by Southern Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean. A total of 2352 daily symptom questionnaires were completed, 9.7% of which had reported symptoms. The most commonly reported symptoms were gastrointestinal (n=115), followed by respiratory (n=102). Symptom type, location, and severity was visualized using maps to see hotspots of infection.\nConclusion: ITIT is a valuable tool to examine patterns of infection on travellers, and can complement existing surveillance systems with its innovative bottom-up, real-time approach."

Schlagenhauf1,4\n1 University of Zürich, Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute, Zürich, Switzerland\n2 HFR Fribourg - Cantonal Hospital, Fribourg, Switzerland\n3 |HU-Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France, WHO Collaborating Centre for Travellers’ Health\n4 Department of Global and Public Health, MilMedBiol Competence Centre, Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute (EBPI), Zürich, Switzerland\nTopic: EMERGING INFECTIONS\nBackground: Travellers are susceptible to respiratory tract infections (RTIs) because they come into close contact with numerous individuals and respiratory pathogens are present year-round in most areas visited. No study has systematically examined the burden of these infections among travellers. We examined the incidence of RTIs and also the incidence of symptoms suggestive of RTIs among travellers stratified by risk groups and/or geographic regions and evaluated the spectrum of RTIs.\nMethods: Our systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA 2020 guidelines) was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022311261). We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, Science Direct, and preprint servers MedRxiv, BioRxiv, SSRN, and IEEE Xplore on February 1, 2022. We included articles reporting at least one RTI or symptom suggestive of RTIs in international travellers after January 1, 2000. Deduplication, inclusion and exclusion criteria, title and abstract screening, full-text assessment, and bias assessment were performed by two reviewers. Data extraction was performed manually twice for each study and merged. Descriptive analyzes and maps were used to represent RTIs cases, respiratory symptoms, and their distribution. Two proportional meta-analyzes were utilized to obtain estimates of the incidence of respiratory symptoms and RTIs in travellers and predefined risk groups.\nResults: Our search yielded 2,042 articles, and a total of 429 articles were included of which 268 were found by screening and 161 by a citation search of included studies. 78% of reported symptoms suggestive of RTIs and 60% of RTIs with available location data were acquired at mass gathering events. Cough was the most common symptom suggestive of respiratory infections, and the upper respiratory tract was the most common site for RTIs in travellers. We found an incidence proportion of respiratory symptoms and RTIs of 0.38 [0.28; 0.49] and 0.12 [0.09; 0.16], respectively among travellers. We found that the incidence of RTIs in travellers was closely correlated to global waves of emerging respiratory infections.\nConclusions: These results demonstrate the high burden of RTIs in travellers regardless of traveller group. This is the first meta-analysis to estimate the incidence proportion of RTIs among travellers by specific area of acquisition."

Baseline characteristics were balanced in all groups. Less than 10% of participants in each group reported having asthma, and more than 75% were physically active at least once a week. No significant differences were found in spirometric measurements, but there was strong evidence of differences in the CPET measures of percent oxygen consumption (p-value: 0.013) and work rate (p-value: 0.014) at the anaerobic threshold (AT1) between the control and the SARS-CoV-2 infected groups.\nConclusions: The study found that young persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 even &gt; 6 months previously had significant differences in cardiovascular fitness and endurance compared to healthy controls. More research is needed to evaluate the trajectory of symptom persistence beyond one year."
